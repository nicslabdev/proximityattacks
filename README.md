# Proximity attacks

This repository contains a framework written in pyhon for reasoning about abstract and practical proximity attacks against mobile targets. 

The `bounds` folder contains code to calculate bounds on the number of queries an attacker needs to locate a random walk victim moving in one and two dimensionsional search spaces. The `strategies` folder contains the code to calculate the effort of practical (contrained) attacker strategies for synthetic and real-word data (T-Drive dataset).
